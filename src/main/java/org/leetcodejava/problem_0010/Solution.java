Problem: Expression Matching

    Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

    '.' Matches any single character.​​​​
    '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
    The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

    Example 1:

    Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
    Output: false
    Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
    Example 2:

    Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
    Output: true
    Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
    Example 3:

    Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
    Output: true
    Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".


    Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 20
    1 <= p.length <= 20
    s contains only lowercase English letters.
    p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.
    It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character '*', there will be a previous valid character to match.
